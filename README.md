# WXT + React + Tailwind + Shadcn + Starter

Starting something from scratch is pain in the ***.

Here's a simple template that leverages - React/Vite and Shadcn and Tailwind(v3) and TypeScript ofcourse.

Start reading docs and make a clone of this and you are good to go.

## Components that are working

- Buttons
- Hover (HoverCard)
- Tooltip (so-far)
- Tabs
- Scroll-Area
- Card
- Input/Label
- Avatar
- Resizable

## Components that are not working

In general any component that is associated with dialog (or is a non-standard implementation) or tend to putrude outside.

Things that didn't worked in my testing.

- Dialog
- Alert-Dialog
- Select
- Dropdown (Menu)

## Things that should work (not tested)

- Input OTP
- Progress
- Radio-Group
- Switch
- Separator
- Skeleton
- Slider
